# last30days: Become Expert → Write Prompts

Research a topic across Reddit and X, internalize the best practices, then write **copy-paste-ready prompts** the user can immediately use with their target tool.

## CRITICAL: Parse User Intent

Before doing anything, parse the user's input for:

1. **TOPIC**: What they want to learn about (e.g., "web app mockups", "Claude Code skills", "image generation")
2. **TARGET TOOL** (if specified): Where they'll use the prompts (e.g., "Nano Banana Pro", "ChatGPT", "Midjourney")

Common patterns:
- `[topic] for [tool]` → "web mockups for Nano Banana Pro" → TOOL IS SPECIFIED
- `[topic] prompts for [tool]` → "UI design prompts for Midjourney" → TOOL IS SPECIFIED
- Just `[topic]` → "iOS design mockups" → TOOL NOT SPECIFIED, that's OK

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask about target tool before research.**
- If tool is specified in the query, use it
- If tool is NOT specified, run research first, then ask AFTER showing results

**Store the TOPIC** - you'll extract or ask about TARGET_TOOL later:
- `TOPIC = [extracted topic]`
- `TARGET_TOOL = [extracted tool, or "unknown" if not specified]`

---

## Setup Check

Verify API key configuration exists:

```bash
if [ ! -f ~/.config/last30days/.env ]; then
  echo "SETUP_NEEDED"
else
  echo "CONFIGURED"
fi
```

### If SETUP_NEEDED

Run NUX flow to configure API keys. Use AskUserQuestion to collect:

1. **OpenAI API Key** (optional but recommended for Reddit research)
2. **xAI API Key** (optional but recommended for X research)

Then create the config:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/last30days
cat > ~/.config/last30days/.env << 'ENVEOF'
# last30days API Configuration
# At least one key is required

OPENAI_API_KEY=
XAI_API_KEY=
ENVEOF

chmod 600 ~/.config/last30days/.env
echo "Config created at ~/.config/last30days/.env"
echo "Please edit it to add your API keys, then run the skill again."
```

**STOP HERE if setup was needed.**

---

## Research Execution

**IMPORTANT: Run WebSearch FIRST, then the script.** This way users see our nice progress display as the "working state" while the slower script runs.

**Step 1: Kick off WebSearch** (runs quickly)
- Search for: `{TOPIC} 2026` (or current year) - find 8-15 pages
- Search for: `{TOPIC} best practices tutorial guide` - find 5-10 more
- EXCLUDE reddit.com, x.com, twitter.com (covered by script)
- INCLUDE: blogs, tutorials, docs, news, GitHub repos
- **DO NOT output "Sources:" list** - this is noise, we'll show stats at the end

**Step 2: Run the research script** (takes longer, shows progress)
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/last30days/scripts/last30days.py "$ARGUMENTS" --emit=compact 2>&1
```

The script displays this progress while running:
```
🚀 Deploying research agents...
├─ 🟠 Reddit Agent: Scanning subreddits for discussions...
└─ 🔵 X Agent: Following the conversation on X...
```

**Depth options** (passed through from user's command):
- `--quick` → Faster, fewer sources (8-12 each)
- (default) → Balanced (20-30 each)
- `--deep` → Comprehensive (50-70 Reddit, 40-60 X)

---

## Judge Agent: Synthesize All Sources

**After all searches complete, display:**
```
✅ Research complete
├─ Reddit: Found {n} threads
├─ X: Found {n} posts
└─ Web: Found {n} pages

⚖️ Synthesizing insights...
```

**The Judge Agent must:**
1. Weight Reddit/X sources HIGHER (they have engagement signals: upvotes, likes)
2. Weight WebSearch sources LOWER (no engagement data)
3. Identify patterns that appear across ALL three sources (strongest signals)
4. Note any contradictions between sources
5. Extract the top 3-5 actionable insights

---

## FIRST: Internalize the Research

**CRITICAL: Ground your synthesis in the ACTUAL research content, not your pre-existing knowledge.**

Read the research output carefully. Pay attention to:
- **Exact product/tool names** mentioned (e.g., if research mentions "ClawdBot" or "@clawdbot", that's a DIFFERENT product than "Claude Code" - don't conflate them)
- **Specific quotes and insights** from the sources - use THESE, not generic knowledge
- **What the sources actually say**, not what you assume the topic is about

**ANTI-PATTERN TO AVOID**: If user asks about "clawdbot skills" and research returns ClawdBot content (self-hosted AI agent), do NOT synthesize this as "Claude Code skills" just because both involve "skills". Read what the research actually says.

Identify from the ACTUAL RESEARCH OUTPUT:
- **PROMPT FORMAT** - Does research recommend JSON, structured params, natural language, keywords? THIS IS CRITICAL.
- The top 3-5 patterns/techniques that appeared across multiple sources
- Specific keywords, structures, or approaches mentioned BY THE SOURCES
- Common pitfalls mentioned BY THE SOURCES

**If research says "use JSON prompts" or "structured prompts", you MUST deliver prompts in that format later.**

---

## THEN: Show Summary + Invite Vision

**CRITICAL: Do NOT output any "Sources:" lists. The final display should be clean.**

**Display in this EXACT sequence:**

```
📊 Research Complete

Analyzed {total_sources} sources from the last 30 days
├─ 🟠 Reddit: {n} threads │ {sum} upvotes │ {sum} comments

└─ Top voices: r/{sub1}, r/{sub2} │ @{handle1}, @{handle2} │ {web_author} on {site}

---
What I learned:

[2-4 sentences synthesizing key insights FROM THE ACTUAL RESEARCH OUTPUT. Quote or paraphrase what the sources said. The synthesis should be traceable back to the research results above.]

KEY PATTERNS I'll use:
1. [Pattern from research]
2. [Pattern from research]
3. [Pattern from research]

---
Share your vision for what you want to create and I'll write a thoughtful prompt you can copy-paste directly into {TARGET_TOOL}.
```

**Use real numbers from the research output.** The patterns should be actual insights from the research, not generic advice.

**SELF-CHECK before displaying**: Re-read your "What I learned" section. Does it match what the research ACTUALLY says? If the research was about ClawdBot (a self-hosted AI agent), your summary should be about ClawdBot, not Claude Code. If you catch yourself projecting your own knowledge instead of the research, rewrite it.

**IF TARGET_TOOL is still unknown after showing results**, ask NOW (not before research):
```
What tool will you use these prompts with?

Options:
1. [Most relevant tool based on research - e.g., if research mentioned Figma/Sketch, offer those]
2. Nano Banana Pro (image generation)
3. ChatGPT / Claude (text/code)
4. Other (tell me)
```

**IMPORTANT**: After displaying this, WAIT for the user to respond. Don't dump generic prompts.

---

## WAIT FOR USER'S VISION

After showing the stats summary with your invitation, **STOP and wait** for the user to tell you what they want to create.

When they respond with their vision (e.g., "I want a landing page mockup for my SaaS app"), THEN write a single, thoughtful, tailored prompt.

---

## WHEN USER SHARES THEIR VISION: Write ONE Perfect Prompt

Based on what they want to create, write a **single, highly-tailored prompt** using your research expertise.

### CRITICAL: Match the FORMAT the research recommends

**If research says to use a specific prompt FORMAT, YOU MUST USE THAT FORMAT:**

- Research says "JSON prompts" → Write the prompt AS JSON
- Research says "structured parameters" → Use structured key: value format
- Research says "natural language" → Use conversational prose
- Research says "keyword lists" → Use comma-separated keywords

**ANTI-PATTERN**: Research says "use JSON prompts with device specs" but you write plain prose. This defeats the entire purpose of the research.

### Output Format:

```
Here's your prompt for {TARGET_TOOL}:

---

[The actual prompt IN THE FORMAT THE RESEARCH RECOMMENDS - if research said JSON, this is JSON. If research said natural language, this is prose. Match what works.]

---

This uses [brief 1-line explanation of what research insight you applied].
```

### Quality Checklist:
- [ ] **FORMAT MATCHES RESEARCH** - If research said JSON/structured/etc, prompt IS that format
- [ ] Directly addresses what the user said they want to create
- [ ] Uses specific patterns/keywords discovered in research
- [ ] Ready to paste with zero edits (or minimal [PLACEHOLDERS] clearly marked)
- [ ] Appropriate length and style for TARGET_TOOL

---

## IF USER ASKS FOR MORE OPTIONS

Only if they ask for alternatives or more prompts, provide 2-3 variations. Don't dump a prompt pack unless requested.

---

## AFTER EACH PROMPT: Stay in Expert Mode

After delivering a prompt, offer to write more:

> Want another prompt? Just tell me what you're creating next.

---

## CONTEXT MEMORY

For the rest of this conversation, remember:
- **TOPIC**: {topic}
- **TARGET_TOOL**: {tool}
- **KEY PATTERNS**: {list the top 3-5 patterns you learned}

When the user asks for another prompt later, you don't need to re-research. Apply what you learned.

---

## Output Summary Footer (After Each Prompt)

After delivering a prompt, end with:

```
---
📚 Expert in: {TOPIC} for {TARGET_TOOL}
📊 Based on: {n} Reddit threads ({sum} upvotes) + {n} X posts ({sum} likes) + {n} web pages

Want another prompt? Just tell me what you're creating next.
```
