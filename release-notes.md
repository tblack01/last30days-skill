The AI world reinvents itself every month. This skill keeps you current.

`/last30days` researches your topic across Reddit, X, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Hacker News, Polymarket, GitHub, and 5+ more sources from the last 30 days, finds what the community is actually upvoting, sharing, betting on, and saying on camera, and writes you a grounded narrative with real citations.

## v3 is the intelligent search release

v3 is a ground-up engine rewrite by [@j-sperling](https://github.com/j-sperling). The old engine searched keywords. The new engine understands your topic first, then searches the right people and communities.

Type "OpenClaw" and v3 resolves @steipete, r/openclaw, r/ClaudeCode, and the right YouTube channels and TikTok hashtags before a single API call fires. Type "Peter Steinberger" and it resolves his X handle and GitHub profile, switches to person mode, and shows what he shipped this month at 85% merge rate across 22 PRs. None of that was on Google.

## Headline features

### Intelligent pre-research

The killer feature. A new Python pre-research brain resolves X handles, GitHub repos, subreddits, TikTok hashtags, and YouTube channels before searching. Bidirectional: person to company, product to founder, name to GitHub profile. The right subreddits, the right handles, the right hashtags, all resolved before a single API call.

### Best Takes

A second LLM judge scores every result for humor, wit, and virality alongside relevance. Every brief now ends with a Best Takes section surfacing the cleverest one-liners and most viral quotes. The Reddit and X people are funny, and the old engine buried their best stuff.

### Cross-source cluster merging

When the same story hits Reddit, X, and YouTube, v3 merges them into one cluster instead of three duplicates. Entity-based overlap detection catches matches even when the titles use different words.

### Single-pass comparisons

"X vs Y" used to run three serial passes (12+ minutes). v3 runs one pass with entity-aware subqueries for both sides at once. Same depth, 3 minutes.

### GitHub person-mode and project-mode

When the topic is a person, the engine switches from keyword search to author-scoped queries. PR velocity, top repos by stars, release notes for what shipped this month, woven into the narrative alongside X posts and Reddit threads.

When the topic is a project, it pulls live star counts, READMEs, releases, and top issues from the GitHub API. No stale blog posts.

### ELI5 mode

Say "eli5 on" after any research run. The synthesis rewrites in plain language. No jargon. Same data, same sources, same citations, just clearer. Say "eli5 off" to go back.

### 13+ sources

v3 adds Threads, Pinterest, Perplexity, Bluesky, and Parallel AI grounding to the existing Reddit, X, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Hacker News, Polymarket, GitHub, and Web lineup. Perplexity Deep Research (`--deep-research`) gives you 50+ citation reports for serious investigation.

### Per-author cap and entity disambiguation

Max 3 items per author prevents single-voice dominance. Synthesis trusts resolved handles over fuzzy keyword matches.

## Install

Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add mvanhorn/last30days-skill
```

OpenClaw:

```
clawhub install last30days-official
```

OpenAI Codex CLI: install the repo as a local Codex marketplace/plugin. The plugin manifest lives at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and the canonical skill payload is `skills/last30days/SKILL.md`.

Zero config. Reddit, Hacker News, Polymarket, and GitHub work immediately. Run it once and the setup wizard unlocks X, YouTube, TikTok, and more in 30 seconds.

## v3 Community

v3 was shaped by community contributors whose PRs and issues inspired core features. Their code wasn't merged directly (v3 was a ground-up rewrite), but their ideas drove what shipped.

Thanks to @uppinote20, @zerone0x, @thinkun, @thomasmktong, @fanispoulinakisai-boop, @pejmanjohn, @zl190, and @hnshah. See [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for the full list.

Contributors who shaped the release itself:

- @Jah-yee (#153) surfaced the need for a real Codex CLI integration, which shipped in #219
- @Cody-Coyote (#204) reported the marketplace validation bug that needed fixing before v3 could ship cleanly
- @dannyshmueli pushed for v3 and Codex family support publicly on X

Full Added / Changed / Fixed detail lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under `[3.0.0]`.

## Earlier contributors

From the v1 and v2 lineage:

- [@galligan](https://github.com/galligan) for marketplace plugin inspiration
- [@hutchins](https://x.com/hutchins) for pushing the YouTube feature

30 days of research. 30 seconds of work. Thirteen sources. Zero stale prompts.
